## Introduction

This mini-project is part of the deliverables in the STAT545A course. It involves installation of the `datateachr` package by Hayley Boyce and Jordan Bourak which currently consists of 7 semi-tidy datasets.

It also requires loading the `datateachr` and `tidyverse` packages which are necessary for a successful completion of the project.

There are 3 major tasks in the project:
1. Choose your favorite dataset
2. Explore your dataset
3. Write your research questions

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I should:
+ Become familiar with the datasets, especially the one I choose to work more indepth with
+ Be able to formulate 4 research questions that I would like to answer with my data
+ Generate a well written and reproducible report using R Markdown
